# Vaccine-Ddistribution
This is an ongoing project where we are trying to develop a web based interface for vaccine distribution system using SIR Model at the national level and as be bifurcate into the state level, we will usefull several other factors along with SIR Results to generate the model.

Here, we have only uploaded the Views.py codes for both the models. We will be uploading all the other files very soon.
